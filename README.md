## HarvardX Data Science Capstone 1: Predicting Movie Ratings

This repository contains the R code and final outputs of the Movie Ratings model generated for my first HarvardX Data Science Capstone.

## Installation

The final PDF report is stored as `danielagarcia-movies-final-report.pdf`. 

To run the code yourself, clone the repository and open the `danielagarcia-capstone-movies.Rproj` file. Run the `danielagarcia-movies-script.R` script to re-generate the necessary `.Rdata` files to create the final Rmd report.

## About the Project

This project takes data on movies and ratings that users have given them to produce a model that predicts future movie ratings. 

The predictive model takes into account the effects that the specific movie, the individual user, the genre(s) of the movie, and the time of rating have on the rating of the movie in order to generate more accurate results. 

The model was trained on training data that provides ratings given different movies and users. After training on this data, a finalized model was selected and predictions were generated on the testing data. These predictions were compared to the true ratings in the testing data to determine the strength of the model.
